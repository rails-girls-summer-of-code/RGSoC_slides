Rails Girls Summer of Code slides
============
Are you a Rails Girls Summer of Code student and up for a (lightning) talk at a conference? You're in luck. We've created this little repo for you, with images you can use, a basic slides layout and some default slides mentioning stats and our awesome sponsors!

How to go about this? Well... ```git clone``` this repo and use it for your own purposes. 
Or just download the files: `2016_example_slides.key` (Keynote) or `2016_example_slides.pdf`. We don't have a powerpoint version, so feel free to create your own from the pdf example (and make a PR if you want to add it to this repo for other students to use).  
If you want to make your own slides, you can find some of our images (including the sponsor logos and our pixel heart) in the `img` folder.   
You can also find more detailed information, links to videos, and some photos on our [press page](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/about/press/).  

Good luck! (or: break a leg!)
