##Hi, we are team {x} working on {x}.

###Introduce yourselves

#### Examples of things you could talk about:

- how did you meet?
- how did you get into programming?
- how did you find your coaches and choose your project together?

###Showcase your project

#### Examples of things you could bring up:

- present your team! (project mentor, coaches, supervisor, and coaching company if you had one)
- what features did you work on?
- what challenges did you encounter, and how did you solve them?
- what things have you learned during RGSoC?

###Data!
Rails Girls Summer of Code helps Rails Girls students get into Open Source. Just like in Google Summer of Code and Outreachy, students will be paid so they're free to work on Open Source projects for three months – from July to September. Unlike those programs, RGSoC is about helping students to further expand their knowledge and skills by contributing to a great Open Source project (rather than producing highly sophisticated code).  
Each team is comprised of two students and has the support of local and remote coaches and a supervisor. Some teams even have a coaching company (that hosts them and offers their coaches).
As of 2017, Rails Girls Summer of Code is in its fifth year!  

#### This year's stats:
#####20 teams
#####40 students
